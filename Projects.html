      <img src="images/Chatbot.jpg" alt="Chat" class="responsive-image">
      <p>This project focuses on our voyage into the world of AI chat bots. Inspired by the increased interest in the
        development of AI and the popularity of ChatGPT, CognitION is our own attempt at creating a sentient chatbot
        that can help with day to day activities and provide knowledge answers to whatever you question. </p>

      <h2>Ars Bellica</h2>
      <img src="images/Bellica.jpg" alt="Board" class="responsive-image">
      <p>This project consists of testing the capabilities of a digital mind and seeing how it adapts to human
        strategies. This is an AI specialized in playing various board games. This project was inspired by chess bots
        being so advanced, a human can not beat them. We decided to branch out to other board games, to allow Ars
        Bellica to create strategies and test whether they work, in order to be perfect at the games played. Some
        popular games it plays are Risk, Monopoly, and Settlers of Catan. </p>
