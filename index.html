        <h2>About Us</h2>

        <p>We are a company that specializes in the creation and training of Artificial Intelligence algorithms. We are
          a small startup that is inspired by the works of other companies such as Deepmind and IBM. Our goal is to help
          aid those who work in the field of machine learning and promote cooperation and collaboration, instead of
          competition. We would like to see artificial intelligence become more integrated in day to day life, after
          seeing the positive effects of some recent development. Both DALLE and chatgpt have paved the way for AI to
          become more mainstream, and now we want to add our contributions. </p>

        <p>We want to create an environment where someone can have an idea and be able to take that idea and create
          something functional. This is a relatively new field that needs to be explored, so we are extremely lenient on
          what is a possibility, because we just don't know yet.</p>

        <p>We want to help provide the ability for humans to go even farther in their evolution with the help of
          machines. It wasn’t that long ago we landed a team of people on the moon with seemingly “ancient” technology.
          We used those computers to do calculations in a fraction of the time it would take a human. Now through
          countless developments, we are able to take a string of computers running calculations and train them to
          think. This is an insane sounding idea, but we are here to see if this idea can be taken to the extremes. We
          aren’t aware if it will work, but that will never stop us from trying. Even if it doesn’t work, we will be
          there to make something extraordinary out of a crazy idea.</p>
