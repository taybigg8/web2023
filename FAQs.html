    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <div class="FAQlist">
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h2>Where are we located?</h2>
                <p>Our main research facility is located in Lexington, Kentucky. We are looking to expand eventually
                    into more areas along the east coast. We are currently considered a startup company, so we are
                    limited by funds and lack of brand recognition. We are doing everything in our power to become
                    reputable and expand.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Where can I buy these projects?</h2>
                <p>Because we are mainly a Research and Development company, we do not sell our projects to the general
                    public. They are in beta at the moment, and once we make progress and get them ready for production,
                    we will change our site to reflect this. You can contact us at 555-123-4567 or ceo@PascalTech.me if
                    you would like to recieve updates on our specific products. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>How do we make money?</h2>
                <p>We make money by relying on other companies investing in us. We are able to do this because investors
                    are confident in our ideas, and are willing to give us money in order to further the types of
                    projects we can create. As we grow, our plan tis to sell our projects ourselves, but we do not have
                    the ability or the funds to do this.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>What is our Mission Statement?</h2>
                <p> Our goal is to help aid those who work in the field of machine learning and promote cooperation and
                    collaboration, instead of competition. We would like to see artificial intelligence become more
                    integrated in day to day life, after seeing the positive effects of some recent development. AI has
                    started to become more mainstream, and now we want to add our contributions. Some companies have
                    questionable ethics or arent really transparent with their goals. We want to be different. We want
                    to improve everyones quality of life, without overstepping ethical boundaries. We are here for the
                    good of mankind. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>How does your company approach the R&D process?</h2>
                <p>We like to express the importantance of trial and error. This is a relatively recent field that has
                    not been fully explored yet. We don't know everything and don't pretend to. In order to make
                    progress in this field, we need to try everything. We make sure to make the research enviroment as
                    stress-free as you can possibly get. When companies rush its researchers the product iself will be
                    rushed and have corners cut. In order to get the most complete and thorough results, we try to
                    minimize this crunch culture. We are flexible with deadlines, because a working result is more
                    important than a met deadline. </p>
